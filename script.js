/*
For the calculator to work.. 
I need each button to capture user input & save it 
ie: any numeral value & the function has to continue running 
until an arthimetric value is pressed. 
(& the decimal point has to be pressed ONCE and then break (maybe a switch statement?)
then; after an arthmetric value is pressed, the user can enter another number
then the calculation is made with enter.

So: 2 values have to be saved. num1 & num2
