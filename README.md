Include a README.md file that provides instructions on using the calculator and any additional notes you want to share.

The calculator functions as follows:
The display is cleared from the beginning.
You can interact with the buttons:
0-9, arithmetic operations, % sign, decimal, C for clear, and the equal sign button.

You can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on the calculator. Please type in a number before using any of the signs, or else an error will appear. 

For any error message displayed, you will have to clear the screen in order to continue using the calculator.


Note: The button "x" & "blank" button do not currently have any function.

Resolved using config pull.rebase true. 
Backup code was stored on a notes document incase of deletion.
